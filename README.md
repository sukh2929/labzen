`labzen` is a Python package that adds more [zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) to your student experience of working on [MDS](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) labs. It lets you manage common tasks such as counting total marks in an assigment, and performs common checks for mechanics in your iPython notebooks and R markdown assignments.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple labzen
```

## Features

**labzen** helps members of the [UBC Master of Data Science (MDS)](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) manage lab assignments written in iPython notebooks and R markdown. The package saves precious student time by automating common tasks such as counting up total marks in a lab assignment, and performing common mechanical checks that can-- if overlooked-- lose a student easy marks.

The package is currently under development, but will include the following functions:

- **Function 1**: The internal `parse_lab()` function will take an MDS .ipynb or .Rmd lab and return its markdown contents as a list/vector of strings. The function will scrub out yaml, code blocks, and all other metadata.

- **Function 2**: `count_points()` will build upon the first function and further parse labs into sections using regex. Further string manipulation will determine how many optional and required points there are per section based on the rubric tags. The function will return a table of totals so that students can plan how many optionals they wish to complete.

- **Function 3**: `check_mechanics()` conduct and print a series of mechanics checks to screen. For example, the function will
    - Check that you have included a Github repo link;
	- Check that you have pushed the latest version; and
	- Check that you have at least three commits.

The package data will include a directory of public and/or dummy lab files (.ipynb and .Rmd). Private or unpublished lab files will not be committed to the repository.

To the authors' knowledge, no package yet exists in the Python ecosystem that serves this specific purpose. However, several existing packages will be used to power the functionality of `labzen`, including `GitPython`, `pandas`, and `nbformat`. 

A parallel implementation for R exists [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/labzenr).

## Dependencies
```
python = "^3.8"
pandas = "^1.2.3"
nbformat = "^5.1.2"
PyGithub = "^1.54.1"
GitPython = "^3.1.14"
glob2 = "^0.7"
mock = "^4.0.3"
```
See the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file for complete list of `labzen` dependencies.
## Usage

Start by generating a token for UBC's Github Enterprise account (instructions [here](https://labzen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/token.html)).

In order to show the functionality of our package, we provided two dummy labs, one [Rmarkdown lab](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/labzen/blob/main/data-raw/dummylab.Rmd) and one [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/labzen/blob/main/data-raw/dummylab.ipynb).

To access the dummy lab files, you can either clone the repository using the following command::

```
$ git clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/labzen.git
```

Or, you can download them in your working directory using the following python code:

``` python

# Download the demo files into the working directory
import urllib.request
baseurl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/labzen/main/data-raw"
labs = {
    "dummylab.Rmd": f"{baseurl}/dummylab.Rmd",
    "dummylab.ipynb": f"{baseurl}/dummylab.ipynb",
}
for name, url in labs.items():
	urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, name)
```

From the root of the repository/ working directory run the following python code:

```python
>>> from labzen import labzen as lz
# for jupyter notebook:
>>> df, tab = lz.count_points("data-raw/dummylab.ipynb")
>>> df
```

![](docs/img/extract_points.jpg)


The table above shows that there are 6 sections in this lab, and whether these points are optional or not. The total number of points is shown in the total column. Since requires quesitons only are meant to get you to a 95% grade, the optionals may imply a total percentage that is less than (or more) than 100% in the prop column. For convenience, the total marks can also be viewed via:

```python
tab
```
![](docs/img/total_points.jpg)


In order to use `check_mechanics`, you need to provide the following arguments to the function: 

- A local path to a Github directory of your MDS lab or an MDS lab file (.ipynb or .Rmd) within such a directory.
- A personal access token for https://github.ubc.ca. See [Github Tokens](https://labzen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/token.html) for a guidline on how to generate your personal token from Github Enterprise.

Then, you can run ``check_mechanics()`` as follows:

``` python

file = "~/MDS/Block5/lab1/DSCI_599_lab1_jene3456"
#for windows you may have to use the following path format
#  C:\\Users\\jene\\MDS\\Block5\\lab\\DSCI_599_lab1_jene3456
token = "544c96ce0d3dc9b66ac8d70b32c07bd0c46129db"
lz.check_mechanics(file, token)
```

```
Check 1: Repository has at least 3 commits with the student
username JENE SMITH
Check 1: True
Check 2: Remote has the latest version of the repository
Check 2: True
Check 3: Repository link is included in the file
Check 3: True
```

`check_mechanics()` checks that you have provided a Github repo link, that you have pushed your latest commit, and that you have at least three commit messages authored by you in your history.
